# CAS Client Overview

To make it easier to develop and test CAS - we should have a CAS client application.  For my development environment, I just install this on our CAS development servers, within Apache httpd.

We'll use this CAS client to test as we go along - including as we build out extra functionality such as MFA, attribute release, service restrictions by group or other attributes, etc.
