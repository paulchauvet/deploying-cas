Who am I?  Well, I'm currently the Information Security Officer in Information Technology Services at SUNY New Paltz, where I've worked since 2003.  Since 2019, I've also been teaching Cybersecurity as an adjunct in the Computer Science department here.

I've been at New Paltz a long time... I graduated in 2001 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering, and went to work in NYC for a couple years before returning back to New Paltz as an employee in late 2003.  While working at the college, I received my MBA in 2011.  I've been working full time in Information Security at the college since 2014.

Why am I still here?  Well I love this school.  It's been a fantastic place to work, I met the love of my life (my wife Diana) here, and I've made many friends over the years here.  Just as importantly - I've had the opportunity to grow in my career here.

When not at work - you may see me at one of the beautiful hiking areas in or around the Hudson Valley.
