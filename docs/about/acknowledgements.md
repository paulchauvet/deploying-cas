# Acknowledgements


I'd like to thank all those who contributed to this - whether via their public documentation, forum posts on the Apereo CAS forums, or directly via email.  This includes:

* David Curry of [The New School](https://newschool.edu) for his amazing [Deploying Apereo CAS](https://dacurry-tns.github.io/deploying-apereo-cas) page which I used to both get CAS 5 going several years ago, and used as a model for this documentation.  Part of the reason I am creating this document is so that others can (hopefully!) get as much benefit from this document for CAS 6 as I did with his for, CAS 5, including the automation portions using Ansible.
* David Warden and Shawn Plummer of [SUNY Geneseo](https://geneseo.edu)
* William Jojo [Hudson Valley Community College](https://hvcc.edu) - who also has a [CAS primer](https://programmingby.design/knowledge-base/a-cas-primer/)
* Ken Runyon of [SUNY System Administration](https://suny.edu)
* Matt Adkins of [Liberty University](https://liberty.edu)
* Richard Schneider of [Harding University](https://harding.edu)
* David Campman of [Forsyte IT](https://forsyteit.com)
* Misagh Moayyed [Fawnoos](https://fawnoos.com)
* My CIO (John Reina) and Vice-President (Michele Halstead) here at [New Paltz](https://newpaltz.edu) for not only giving me the time to work on this documentation - but also encouraging me to release it publicly for the higher ed community.
* And all the developers who have contributed to the [Apereo CAS](https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas) project and who contribute in the [CAS Community](https://apereo.github.io/cas/Mailing-Lists.html#cas-community-list-cas-userapereoorg).

My sincere apologies if I forgot anyone!  Please let me know if that's the case.
