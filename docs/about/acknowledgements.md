# Acknowledgements


I'd like to thank all those who contributed to this - whether via their public documentation, forum posts on the Apereo CAS forums, or directly via email.  This includes David Curry of [The New School](https://newschool.edu), David Warden and Shawn Plummer of [SUNY Geneseo](https://geneseo.edu), Ken Runyon of [SUNY System Administration](https://suny.edu), Matt Adkins of [Liberty University](https://liberty.edu), David Campman of [Forsyte IT](https://forsyteit.com), and all the developers who have contributed to the [Apereo CAS](https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas) project and who contribute in the [CAS Community](https://apereo.github.io/cas/Mailing-Lists.html#cas-community-list-cas-userapereoorg).

The organization (and not a small amount of the content, especially the base Tomcat configuration guidelines) is straight from David Curry's [Deploying Apereo CAS 5](https://dacurry-tns.github.io/deploying-apereo-cas/) site - so special thanks go to him.  I used his documentation as a starting point when we first moved from CAS 4.x to 5.x a few years ago.  Part of the reason I am creating this document is so that others can (hopefully!) get as much benefit from this document for CAS 6 as I did with his for, CAS 5, including the automation portions using Ansible.
