## Ansible Playbooks

I've put a copy of my ansible playbooks that are used in this document at:
(https://github.com/paulchauvet/ansible-playbooks)

These are copied from my production ansible host - so there's at least some things that aren't relevant here - like references to RHEL 7 hosts.

I haven't yet copied over all my Ansible playbooks to github yet (I usually use an on-site git repo for this) - but I'll move some other Ansible roles in here at some point when I have time to review/santize/generalize them.

As with everything else I've posted - there is no warranty or guarantee for any of this.  Use at your own risk.
