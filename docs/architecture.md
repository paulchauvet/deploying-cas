# System/Architecture Overview

This document was created to reflect the environment in use at New Paltz for CAS:
* [Apereo CAS 6.2.x](https://apereo.github.io/cas/6.2.x/index.html)
* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](https://redhat.com)
* [Apache Tomcat 9.0.x](https://tomcat.apache.org)
* [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.com)
* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com)

If you want to use another version of CAS 6.x - it may or may not have significant changes.  I'll be moving from CAS 6.2 to 6.3 and will document any issues as I come across them, at least in our environment.

If you are going to use another operating system, web server, or java servlet container, I'd imagine the CAS portion of the instructions will be relatively similar - though the Ansible deployments for Tomcat may be less similar or useful.
