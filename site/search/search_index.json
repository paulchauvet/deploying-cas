Apereo CAS 6.2.x Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Apache Tomcat 9.0.x Apache httpd Ansible Azure Active Directory Microsoft Active Directory Duo for Multifactor authentication Hazelcast Ticket Registry for ticket storage between systems. If you want to use another version of CAS 6.x - it may or may not have significant changes. I'll be moving from CAS 6.2 to 6.3 and will document any issues as I come across them, at least in our environment. If you are going to use another operating system, web server, or java servlet container, I'd imagine the CAS portion of the instructions will be relatively similar - though the Ansible deployments for Tomcat may be less similar or useful. Design We have three levels of CAS here at New Paltz, Production, Test, and Development. Test is used for non-production applications that still need SSO (for example Banner test). Development is exclusively used for building, and testing, new versions or configuration changes for CAS. Authentication will be against either: On-prem Active Directory (for alumni) Azure Active Directory (for active faculty/staff/students, and retirees) (we may eventually have all alumni in Azure - but that's for a later date. For now - they are only on-prem and really are only kept active for a couple systems) In each case - the hosts sit behind a load balancer (in our case, F5 Big IP, though HA Proxy or basically any other load balancer should work. We're not doing anything crazy at the LB level). The load balancer is split in multiple locations, as are the application servers. This gives us resilience if a single site on-campus is down but does NOT give resilience against a full outage on-campus. This is one reason why we are looking to have as many services as possible authenticate directly against Azure instead of CAS. Using CAS to delegate authentication to Azure, we can make this transition as streamlined as possible without having people enter login credentials more than once. This will also let us make our transition of existing CAS apps to SAML gradually instead of having to deal with a ton of internal and external service providers all at once.","title":"Architecture/design"},{"location":"about/architecture/#systemarchitecture-overview","text":"","title":"System/Architecture Overview"},{"location":"about/architecture/#components","text":"This document was created to reflect the environment in use at New Paltz for CAS.

I've set that system up several years ago - so I may have missed a step or two here. I'll try to recreate this from scratch later though. Install and Configure git We keep our code for git in an internal git repository running Bitbucket Server . We make enough changes to CAS and Ansible that I would be insane to not use git or some other form of version control for development. Whether you do or not is up to you - but the instructions here assume you are using some sort of git repository. If you aren't familiar with Git - I recommend Pro Git, available online for free via (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Install and basic configuration of Git This should be done as the user you are going to be running Ansible and building CAS from - NOT root. yum install git git config --global user.name \"Your Name Here\" git config --global user.email \"Your Email Here\" Install Ansible We are using the version of Ansible that comes with RedHat. This was just installed via: yum install ansible Set up SSH public key authentication If you're deploying via Ansible, or just using SCP/SFTP to copy files over, you'll want to set up public key authentication. From the master server: When done - view the contents of the public key (by default in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) - you'll need it in the next step. From the CAS servers: Edit the file /root/.ssh/authorized_keys Place the contents of the public key in that file. Test Login to your build server as the user you will be building CAS and running ansible from (I'll use 'builduser' as an example here). See if you can login to one of your newly built CAS servers without entering a password. ssh root@cas6dev1 If successful - you'll be logged in without a username or password. If this is the first time you are connecting via SSH from the build host to the CAS host, you'll be warned that the authenticity of the host cannot be established, and you'll be prompted to enter yes to continue connecting. Configure a hosts file for Ansible You will need a hosts file for Ansible. This file can have simply the hostname, or it could have some variables as well. We at New Paltz put a few things there such as the hostname, the VM name (in vCenter), the folder (in vCenter), and the Tomcat version (so I can roll out updates to Tomcat in some environments earlier than others). An example of this for CAS servers is below. This file would be in /etc/ansible/hosts: [CAS_DEV] cas6dev1 vmware_name=\"CAS 6 Test 1\" vmware_folder=\"/Computer Services/vm/CAS Authentication Servers\" tomcat_major_ver=9.0 tomcat_ver=9.0.41 jdk_version=11 cas6dev2 vmware_name=\"CAS 6 Test 2\" vmware_folder=\"/Computer Services/vm/CAS Authentication Servers\" tomcat_major_ver=9.0 tomcat_ver=9.0.41 jdk_version=11 [CAS_TEST] cas6test1 vmware_name=\"CAS 6 Test 1\" vmware_folder=\"/Computer Services/vm/CAS Authentication Servers\" tomcat_major_ver=9.0 tomcat_ver=9.0.41 jdk_version=11 cas6test2 vmware_name=\"CAS 6 Test 2\" vmware_folder=\"/Computer Services/vm/CAS Authentication Servers\" tomcat_major_ver=9.0 tomcat_ver=9.0.41 jdk_version=11 [CAS_PROD] cas6prod1 vmware_name=\"CAS 6 Test 1\" vmware_folder=\"/Computer Services/vm/CAS Authentication Servers\" tomcat_major_ver=9.0 tomcat_ver=9.0.41 jdk_version=11 cas6prod2 vmware_name=\"CAS 6 Test 2\" vmware_folder=\"/Computer Services/vm/CAS Authentication Servers\" tomcat_major_ver=9.0 tomcat_ver=9.0.41 jdk_version=11","title":"Build Environment"},{"location":"setting-up-the-environment/build-environment/#build-environment","text":"Summary My build server is our existing Ansible host.
